# Hackathon Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository for hackathon projects! This repo contains all the code, resources, and documentation for the various hackathons I've participated in.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my hackathon submissions, showcasing my work on different challenges, technologies, and team collaborations. Each project is organized in its own folder with relevant files and details.

## Structure

- Each hackathon project is stored in a dedicated folder named after the event or project title.
- Folders typically include:
  - Source code
  - Documentation (e.g., project description, setup instructions)
  - Any additional assets (e.g., images, datasets)
