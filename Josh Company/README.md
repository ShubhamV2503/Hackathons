# 🚨 Scam Call Detection - Josh Hackathon Project

Welcome to our submission for the **Josh Hackathon**, where we tackled the real-world challenge of **detecting scam calls** using data-driven and machine learning techniques. This project is aimed at enhancing user safety by identifying suspicious or fraudulent phone calls in real time.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Scam calls are a growing concern, tricking users into sharing sensitive information. Our goal was to **build an intelligent system that can flag scam calls** based on voice/audio patterns, metadata, and behavioral indicators.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost)**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLTK, SpaCy)**
- **Audio Processing (Librosa, PyDub)**
- **Flask** for model deployment
- **Streamlit** for interactive demo (optional)
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for visualization

## 🚀 Features

- 📞 Analyzes call audio and metadata to detect scam patterns
- 🎯 Classifies calls as *Scam* or *Safe* with high accuracy
- 🔍 Supports real-time or batch processing of call logs
- 🧠 Built-in model interpretability using SHAP or LIME (optional)

## 📊 Model Performance

- Accuracy: **XX%**  
- Precision: **XX%**  
- Recall: **XX%**
