# 🧠 CT Scan Image Denoising & Brain Tumor Analysis  

## 📖 Introduction  
This project focuses on **enhancing brain CT scans** by reducing acquisition noise using a **CNN-based autoencoder**, followed by **tumor detection** on the refined images.  

The workflow ensures that critical anatomical details are preserved while improving diagnostic accuracy.  
A lightweight **Flask web app** allows clinicians or researchers to upload CT scans (`.dcm` format) and instantly visualize denoised results along with tumor classification.  

Deployed seamlessly on **AWS EC2** (remote access via PuTTY).

👉 **`app.py`** acts as the entry point — handling:  
- DICOM loading & preprocessing  
- Autoencoder inference (denoising)  
- Tumor classification on denoised scans  
- Evaluation metrics (SNR, classification report)  
- Flask-based web serving

## 🚀 Core Features  

- 🧠 **Noise Reduction**: Autoencoder removes CT noise while retaining diagnostic details.  
- 🩺 **Tumor Prediction**: Classifier identifies tumor presence on enhanced images.  
- 📊 **Metrics**: Includes SNR improvement tracking & classification reports.  
- 🌍 **Cloud Deployment**: Flask app hosted on **AWS EC2** for remote usage.

## 📊 Performance Snapshot  

✅ **Classification Accuracy**:  
- Before denoising → **0.37**  
- After denoising → **0.84**  

✅ **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):**  

| Condition        | SNR (dB) |
|------------------|----------|
| Raw CT (noisy)   | 2.94     |
| After Denoising  | 15.58    |
